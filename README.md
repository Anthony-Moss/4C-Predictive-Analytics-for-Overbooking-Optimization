# Inspiration
Each year, approximately 1 million guests are relocated due to overbooking. Walking guests costs the hotel industry an estimated $5 billion per year.

# What it does
4C is a cloud-based application that leverages predictive analytics to get actionable insights for optimizing overbookings by hotel sales managers. It relies on historical occupancy data, current & future reservations, variable room costs and walk costs to forecast the optimal rate of overbooking.

# How we built it
See architecture in gallery above

# Challenges we ran into
Setting up authorization flow with 3rd-party hotel API
Getting access to data & sort through it
Narrow down problem scope
Develop algorithm & data science to get problem insights

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Team-wide contributions where each member was able & willing to help in their field of expertise
Fully-functional app that actually works
Working data pipelines to ingest & analyze real data in real-time from 3rd party APIs.
Rapid focus in defining problem so we can prioritize objectives, divide tasks, plan and execute in short timeframe
Fantastic team chemistry

# What we learned
The power of working in a multi-functional team
The invaluable insights one can get from existing data
What's next for 4C - Predictive Analytics for Overbooking Optimization
Develop ability to input additional variables such as events and weather to algorithm to calculate cost and opportunity
Give hotels ability to view data by day of week, reservation type, loyalty status and more
Incorporate data from additional APIs to accurately forecast demand for similar properties
Leverage more machine learning to optimize forecast for all variables.
