       <p>Hotels use overbooking as a revenue management strategy to optimize RevPAR. While this approach does increase profitability, overbooking can cause problems for travelers and hotels. When a hotel is unable to accommodate a guest due to overbooking,
         the Front Desk Staff must find a suitable alternative for the guest. Costs include a room at another hotel, meals, transportation, vouchers or other forms of compensation. Walking guests can also be costly in terms of staff overhead.
       </p>

       <p>
         More importantly, overbooking can create a negative customer experience. Seventy percent of guests who are walked say they will not return to the hotel brand. Most (78%) of guests who are walked say they are extremely unlikely to return to the hotel.
         Almost half of these guests are likely to leave a negative review on social media or a travel review site. Research shows that the total cost of walking a guest is $5k.
